# Immersive Learning Technology for Autism using AR & VR

Implemented a system to improve the development & To manage the behavioral patterns of patients with autism. With the help of our system we give them a controlled virtual environment to help them live a independent life
Autism - Its a disorder where the patients lacks in social & communication skills.

Implemented a system to improve the development & To manage the behavioral patterns of patients with autism. With the help of our system we give them a controlled virtual environment to help them live a independent life

In our systems there are multiple modules:
One of the many modules is teaching them how to cross a road - In which the user will experience live crossing of a road with real world interactive elements like cars, signals & roads

Technologies Used:
Designed in blender, Environment Design & Integration in Unity, Firebase is used for Database
